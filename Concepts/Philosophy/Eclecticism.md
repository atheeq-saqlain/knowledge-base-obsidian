# Definition
The **approach** of 'not holding on rigidly to a single paradigm' and deriving ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources to achieve the best possible result

# Explanation
The approach of deriving ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources.

The term comes from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") ἐκλεκτικός (_eklektikos_), literally "choosing the best" and that from ἐκλεκτός (_eklektos_), "picked out, select".

**Eclecticism** is a conceptual approach that does not hold rigidly to a single [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm") or set of assumptions, but instead draws upon multiple theories, styles, or ideas to gain complementary insights into a subject, or applies different theories in particular cases. However, this is often without conventions or rules dictating how or which theories were combined.
