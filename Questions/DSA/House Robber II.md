# House Robber II

## Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` where `nums[i]` represents the amount of money the `i`th house has. The houses are arranged in a circle, i.e. the first house and the last house are neighbors.

You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob **two adjacent houses** because the security system will automatically alert the police if two adjacent houses were _both_ broken into.

Return the _maximum_ amount of money you can rob **without** alerting the police.

## Description

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [3,4,3]

Output: 4
```

Explanation: You cannot rob `nums[0] + nums[2] = 6` because `nums[0]` and `nums[2]` are adjacent houses. The maximum you can rob is `nums[1] = 4`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,9,8,3,6]

Output: 15
```

Explanation: You cannot rob `nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 16` because `nums[0]` and `nums[4]` are adjacent houses. The maximum you can rob is `nums[1] + nums[4] = 15`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 200`
