This is a project made with the [[Obsidian]] tool based on the [[Concepts/Zettelkasten]] method of note taking 

# Contents of this project
In the root folder are the main groupings of the types of notes that are stored 
Each group has a Template associated with it, in the Templates folder. The notes are defined into the following groups : 
### Concepts
The concept notes must hold a single idea defined in a concise manner. Only the definition of the concept must contain links to other notes. 
###### Definition
The definition is the most important part of the concept as it encapsulates the whole idea and gives clarity to it. Mark the property `isDefinitionComplete` as checked (`true`)
###### Explanation
This can have an elaboration of the above stated definition of the concept including examples, illustrations and any kind of tool necessary for better understanding of the concept.  *This part must not contain links to other notes*

### Skills
This in this current context can be defined as a group of concepts required to achieve something of value.

### Tools
Things developed to enhance skills, example : the tool **Obsidian** is used for **zettelkasten**

### People

### Countries

# Plugins and configurations
# Process of adding notes
TLDR ; Follow the top down approach - **Skill** --> **Resource**  --> **Concept** 

Add a skill that you want to learn and start listing down the concepts required.

Add resource note using template in the **Resources** folder and start adding concepts learnt in the note.

Create the concepts noted in the resource note by replacing the text to links and creating a new note in the concepts folder. These can grouped in the proper folders at the same time or later on
